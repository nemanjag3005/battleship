# Battleship

## Battleship is a naval war-themed strategy game

You and your opponent are competing navy commanders at sea. You have a fleet of ships positioned at secret coordinates and take turns firing torpedoes at each other. The goal is to be the first to sink the other personâ€™s whole fleet.

## History

The game dates back to WWI when it was played with pencil and paper. Most people know it by the plastic board game produced by Milton Bradley in 1967. Since then, the game has spawned various physical and digital variations.

## This version

My goal is to learn React Native and improve my Javascript skills. I chose to build this particular game because it is a game I play with my girlfriend often when we are bored. I wanted to digitize the game and create my own app through which we can play it.
